## Age Comparison

1. Declare two variables to store the ages of Akbar and Indra. Assign Akbar's age as 10 and Indra's age as 21.
2. Use an if-else statement to compare their ages.
3. If Akbar's age is greater than Indra's age, print "Akbar is older than Indra".
4. If Akbar's age is less than Indra's age, print "Akbar is younger than Indra".
5. If both ages are equal, print "Akbar and Indra are of the same age".
