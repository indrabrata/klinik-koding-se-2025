# ConditionalStatement Challenge

## Age Comparison

1. Declare two variables to store the ages of Akbar and Indra. Assign Akbar's age as 10 and Indra's age as 21.
2. Use an if-else statement to compare their ages.
3. If Akbar's age is greater than Indra's age, print "Akbar is older than Indra".
4. If Akbar's age is less than Indra's age, print "Akbar is younger than Indra".
5. If both ages are equal, print "Akbar and Indra are of the same age".

## Number Checker

1. Declare a variable to store an integer number.
2. Use an if statement to check whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
3. Inside the positive check, use another if to determine if the number is even or odd.
4. Print the result based on the checks:
   - If the number is positive and even → "The number is positive and even".
   - If the number is positive and odd → "The number is positive and odd".
   - If the number is negative → "The number is negative".
   - If the number is zero → "The number is zero".
5. Test the program with different values for the number variable to ensure all conditions are handled correctly.

## Check Day of the Week

1. Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 7.
2. Store the input in a variable.
3. Use a switch-case statement to map the number to a day of the week:

   - 1 → Monday
   - 2 → Tuesday
   - 3 → Wednesday
   - 4 → Thursday
   - 5 → Friday
   - 6 → Saturday
   - 7 → Sunday

4. Print the corresponding day name.
5. If the number is not in the range 1–7, print "Invalid input, please enter 1–7".
