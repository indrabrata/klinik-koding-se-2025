# Operation Challenge

## Simple Calculator

1. Create a Java program that functions as a simple calculator.
2. Declare two variables to store integer values, for example, `num1` and `num2`.
3. Perform the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, modulus.
4. Print the results of each operation to the console using `System.out.println`.
5. Ensure that the division operation handles division by zero appropriately by checking if `num2` is not zero before performing the division.

## Get Day, Hour, Minute, Second from Second

1. Create scanner to get user input.
2. Ask the user to enter a number of seconds (integer).
3. Convert the entered seconds into days, hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.
4. Use if-else statements to handle the conversion logic.
5. Print the result in the format: "X days, Y hours, Z minutes, W seconds".
   **Example:**

```text
Input: 100000
Output: 1 days, 3 hours, 46 minutes, 40 seconds
```
