# Operation Challenge

## Simple Calculator

1. Create a Java program that functions as a simple calculator.
2. Declare two variables to store integer values, for example, `num1` and `num2`.
3. Perform the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, modulus.
4. Print the results of each operation to the console using `System.out.println`.
5. Ensure that the division operation handles division by zero appropriately by checking if `num2` is not zero before performing the division.
